# A shiny hunting application for Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/releases?style=for-the-badge)

## A fully functional shiny hunting application written entirely in Python. This application fully automates the following:

* Walking to find encounters in grass
* Detecting if an encounter is a shiny Pokemon
* Exiting the battle if it is not a shiny
* Resume walking to find encounters in grass
* Tracking the encounters and saving them into a JSON

## DISCLAIMER
This application is only intended to be used with an emulator, such as mGBA. I cannot and will not provide any game ROMs, nor do I take responsibility for any damages that may happen if someone were to download and use a game ROM.
